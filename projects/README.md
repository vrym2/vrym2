Master of Science: Satellite Data Science

<ins>Study Modules</ins>
* Term1 - Fundamentals of GIS, R programming for data science, Earth Observation of atmosphere, Remote Sensing.
* Term2 - Satellite Data Analysis in Python, Geospatial Data Analysis, Geospatial Database Information Retrieval, Big data, and predictive analysis.

<ins>Project 1 – Urban Air Monitoring System and Health (UAMS-H) (R-Studio)</ins>
* Lead the development of an air quality monitoring prototype web application as the Project Manager, effectively assimilating Satellite data acquisition and visualisation through 'R' programming.

<ins>Project 2 – Satellite Data Analysis on California Dixie Fire (2021) (Google- Colab)</ins>
* Automatic data acquisition (with Google Earth Engine and Copernicus Data Hub), pre-processing, analysis, and visualisation of pre- and post-Dixie fire have been conducted in Colab (python programming). For a brief look into the project, please open this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QQfcRFhfrO57x5y4Fr1R3VBz8RsZkplg?usp=sharing) to the report and for [code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pSHSG5InkEfz5Bm_xjaWDRPEgc1MSTjg?usp=sharing).

<ins>Project 3 – U.S. Diabetic patient data analysis and readmit prediction (Google Colab)</ins>
* Worked on U.S patient data to predict whether a patient is going to be readmitted, utilizing K-Means clustering, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and other ML algorithms.

<ins>Project 4 – Spatial analysis of pipeline accidents in the state of PA, US (R-Studio)</ins>
* Gaussian and Kernel Densities of pipeline accidents have been analysed in this project to determine the risk of contamination utilising spatial variability. This project has been performed utilizing R programming languages and the code can be found in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ny6OlehCcSj06Yj1zOclL_jdbI5oVfaP?usp=sharing).
